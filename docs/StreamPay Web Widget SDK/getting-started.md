# Getting Started

@stream-pay/streampay-widget-sdk allows you to easily integrate the StreamPay widget into your web app and communicate with it. Using this SDK is not necessary, although it will simplify your experience and therefore is recommended. It's written with TypeScript, with all the typings defined out of the box.
