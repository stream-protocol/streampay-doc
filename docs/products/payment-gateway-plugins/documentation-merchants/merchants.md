Step 1: Download Latest Plugin Here: https://github.com/stream-protocol/stream-payment-gateway-plugin or search Stream Payment Gateway in WordPress/WooCommerce Plugin Repository

Step 2: Install Stream Payment Gateway and activate the WordPress plugin.

Step 3: Go to WooCommerce – Settings – Payments – StreamPay Gateway. Customize the description as you would like, enter in your SPL Token or Phantom Wallet Address that you would like to receive your payments into under “Live public key” (or use a test one if you would like to test first) Finally, click Save Settings. 

We recommend Phantom wallet for the Live public key address source, but you can really use any as a merchant.

Step 4: Buy Solana (SOL) at a Cryptocurrency Exchange like Binance, or Coinbase. Then send that Solana to your Phantom wallet address. 

Next go StreamSwap a small amount at StreamSwap Aggregator or Jupiter Aggregator here. This ensures you have the correct USDC token in your wallet, using the swap link, and be sure to keep some Solana in the same wallet to be able to transfer your USDC out (Solana is used as the transaction fee to process all token transactions, even USDC)

#### Alternatively: 

You can go to “Manage Token List” and enable USDC in your Merchant Live public key wallet to successfully receive the token. See screenshots on this page for help. You will still need a small amount of Solana to withdraw (send) your USDC to an exchange (we recommend Binance, they specifically accept USDC on SPL (Solana) tokens under deposits. 

All USDC is not the same, and Coinbase does not yet support USDC or EURC SPL stablecoins. Be careful about this.

Step 5: That’s it! You’re good to go and accept USDC, EURC on Solana via Phantom (other wallets coming soon) We recommend making a low price (we tested a $0.01 USDC product) product and test and ensure the payment ends up in your merchant wallet with no issues.
