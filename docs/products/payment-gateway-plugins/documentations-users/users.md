Step 1: We recommend Phantom wallet for users. (more wallet support coming very soon) Have users download this wallet first. The plugin works and is fully tested with Phantom desktop extension, and with their mobile browser (go to the website in the wallet browser and complete payment as normal).

Step 2. Purchase Solana (SOL) via the in-wallet StreamPay or Moonpay with credit card, or transfer Solana (SOL) from a reputable exchange like Coinbase, Uniswap or Binance to your Phantom wallet address.

Step 3. Swap enough of your Solana for USDC, or EURC for your purchase, while leaving some Solana for transaction fee (gas as known on Ethereum) – 0.02 Solana should be enough. You can use the Swap function in Phantom, or a reputable swap decentralized exchange like Jupiter Aggregator. Then you should have your USDC, EURC and your SOL (for transaction fee) in your Phantom Wallet.

Step 4: Connect your wallet on checkout page, then click Pay with “StreamPay” as seen in screenshot below. Wait for confirmation and order complete page from WordPress/WooCommerce, and if all works well then you will get your order received email and see the normal checkout confirmation page. If you see an error or the transaction does not go through from your wallet, it will not send you to the order received WooCommerce page, and you can simply try again, it maybe a temporary Solana network error. If it continues to fail please contact the store owner.
